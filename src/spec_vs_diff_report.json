  "summary": "Diff implements several requested technical SEO/perf items (lazy-loaded sections, React Query caching tweaks, robots/sitemap, SEO meta tags, JSON-LD component, validation checklist). However, it also introduces multiple visible UI/copy/style changes (violating the pixel-identical constraint), adds backend logic changes, and the JSON-LD and image-modern-format requirements appear only partially met.",
